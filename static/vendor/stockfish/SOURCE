Files:
  stockfish.js   - stockfish-18-lite-single.js (JS loader / worker, ~21KB)
  stockfish.wasm - stockfish-18-lite-single.wasm (WASM binary, ~7MB)

The "lite" build uses a smaller neural network and is ~7MB total vs ~113MB
for the full build.  The "single" variant does not require SharedArrayBuffer
/ cross-origin isolation headers, though our server provides them.

To upgrade:
  npm install stockfish@latest
  cp node_modules/stockfish/bin/stockfish-18-lite-single.js static/vendor/stockfish/stockfish.js
  cp node_modules/stockfish/bin/stockfish-18-lite-single.wasm static/vendor/stockfish/stockfish.wasm
